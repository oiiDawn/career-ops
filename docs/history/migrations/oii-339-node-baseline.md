<!-- Maps the retained Node application behavior to the OII-339 Python cutover. -->

# OII-339 Node behavior baseline

| Node behavior | Python replacement |
|---|---|
| `application-lifecycle.mjs view` | `application view` |
| `application-lifecycle.mjs followups` | `application followups` |
| `application-lifecycle.mjs transition` | LangGraph `validate -> commit` transition |
| `application-lifecycle.mjs activity` | LangGraph `validate -> commit` activity |
| `application-outcome.mjs` outcome mapping and preserved-artifact response | LangGraph `validate -> commit` outcome with current artifact references |
| `followup-cadence.mjs` active states, profile/default intervals, urgency, cold cutoff and overdue filter | `application followups` over canonical lifecycle and sent-activity dates |
| `followup-cadence.mjs` intermediary, notes, sent-history and report context | `application followups` fields from submission, activity and retained score result |
| `followup-seed.mjs` next-date pins and `followup-cadence.mjs` cleared directives | idempotent LangGraph `application schedule`, `retire`, and `reopen` directives |
| `store.mjs` applied/responded/interview/offer/rejected/discarded/hired states and forward-only edges | `STATUSES` and `TRANSITIONS` |
| candidate-confirmed submission after a verified package | explicit `application submit --confirmed` after a confirmed Python apply result |

Python additionally binds every write to an idempotency key. Replaying a
completed operation returns the retained result without adding an event or
activity. Package confirmation remains distinct from the user's report that an
application was actually submitted.
Application lifecycle acceptance uses isolated business samples; it does not
require the candidate to submit a real application. Legacy Markdown follow-up
CLIs remain separate from the canonical Python application records.
